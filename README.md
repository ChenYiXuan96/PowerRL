## Solving power system unit commitment problem using reinforcement learning

This is the code for part of my dissertation in North China Electric Power University. In this project, unit commitment problems in the power systems  share similarities but are not exactly the same is studied. The proximal policy optimisation (PPO) is used to train the actor and critic that are built with dense neural network.
